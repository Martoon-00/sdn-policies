delays:
  ## Here one can specify rule to evaluate delays in message delivery.
  ## No delays are passed as
  # steady # or 'null'
  ##
  ## Also constant delay can be specified:
  # ms: 333
  ## Or a time range:
  # min:
  #   ms: 10
  # max:
  #   sec: 1
  ## in this case, for each message delay is picked randomly according to uniform distribution.
  ## This means, that messages may come not in FIFO order, but algorithm is still supposed
  ## to work in such conditions.
  ##
  ## Support for more complex rules in config to be provided:
  # - temporal/delayed rules
  # - per-node rules
  # - messages loss

recovery:
  delay: 3
lifetime: 5
